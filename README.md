# PetClassificationModel
Using Convolutional layer to distinguish between cats and dogs
We have used only 20 images of cats and dogs to train the model. Hence the accuracy is very low. But the aim of this project is how to build a classification system using images of animals using CNN. So it is about process and not final accuracy.
